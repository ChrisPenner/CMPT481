\section{Problem}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Current Budgeting apps are not user friendly
    \item It's tough visualize how much we're spending on what
    \item It's tough to input expenses/costs, clunky interfaces and cost entry
    \item Difficulties discourage people from actually tracking their expenses
\end{enumerate}

(Include crappy interface photos here)

\section{Motivation}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Want to display data clearly at a glance in a way that encourages action
\item Allow people to understand where they're using their money
\item Encourage saving money
\item Improve transparency in your budget
\item Reduce friction in inputting expenses so people actually do it.
\item Mobile friendly solution
\item Budgeting apps are only useful if people log ALL expenses, so it needs to be effortless.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Solution}

Our application seeks to address the aforementioned problems by implementing a
simple-to-use interface that streamlines the experience by omitting any
unnecessary frills and features in an attempt to focus the user on the areas
that are most important. Our application will feature a 'Quick Expense' screen
which allows users to enter an expense in its category in a matter of seconds.
We will experiment with the trade-off between accuracy and ease-of-use, for
example omitting the cents portion of cost inputs to simplify the interface.

Another component of ease-of-use is availability, which
we provide by implementing the system as a mobile friendly web application which
can be accessed from anywhere internet is available. This ensures that the user 
has access to the application at the time that they are completing transactions.

The primary action of viewing spending habits involves presenting data in a way
that is easy for the consumer to both view and act upon. The most important
metric of past spending is how the amount spent in each category relates to
their expected cost in that area. This application will allow views of expenses
over time filterable by category; the amount spent in the category will be
contrasted with the expected amount spent in that category over that time
interval as predicted by the user. This allows the user to determine areas where
there is a misalignment between their actions and intentions giving them an
actionable area of improvement.

\subsection{Steps to Solution}

Several steps are required to achieve our goals.  We will begin by prototyping
several user-interfaces which facilitate our primary actions. We may involve
external parties to determine which interfaces are the easiest to understand in
an attempt to make the interface as self-evident as possible. This stage should
result in a prototype for the 'Quick Expense' screen, one for the 'Expenses
Viewer' screen, and a notion for how to tie the two screens together.

At this point we may begin to consider our implementation, and will take time
to examine possible data models and system infrastructure. We should ensure
that our models are flexible enough to adapt to the inevitable changes that will
occur during the concrete implementation stage.

Once we have an understanding of how our application will be linked together we
may begin our implementation. We will start by implementing an MVP (minimal
viable product) which has the bare minimum functionality in each section so that
we can get a feel for how the application operates. We will then perform
progressive enhancement on each component until we are satisfied.

We will require a REST-ful API for any data that will be persisted. We will of
course need to implement the views and behaviour for the 'Quick Expense' and
'Expenses Viewer' screens. Since user experience is a top priority we will spend
significant time improving look and feel through styling and animations.

\section{Evaluation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Time a user inputting expenses on our app vs. competitors (ours should be faster)
    \item Time a user as they evaluate their spending on our app vs competitors
    \item Qualitative comparisons of ease of use vs competitors
    \item Qualitative representation of how enjoyable navigating and using the app is.
\end{enumerate}
