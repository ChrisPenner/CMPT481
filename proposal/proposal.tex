\section{Problem}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Current Budgeting apps are not user friendly
    \item It's tough visualize how much we're spending on what
    \item It's tough to input expenses/costs, clunky interfaces and cost entry
    \item Difficulties discourage people from actually tracking their expenses
\end{enumerate}
 However, Current Applications for budgeting are not very easy to use or very
 engaging. With the current applications inputting spending and seeing how you
 are spending your money is not as easy or quick as it could be.  

(Include crappy interface photos here)

\section{Motivation}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Want to display data clearly at a glance in a way that encourages action
\item Allow people to understand where they're using their money
\item Encourage saving money
\item Improve transparency in your budget
\item Reduce friction in inputting expenses so people actually do it.
\item Mobile friendly solution
\item Budgeting apps are only useful if people log ALL expenses, so it needs to be effortless.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Solution}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mobile first web-app
    \item Allows inputting expenses in a matter of seconds
    \item Allows at a glance view of spending habits
    \item 'Quick Expense' screen
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Steps to Solution}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Spec out data models
    \item Create restful API for models
    \item Create the Quick Expense Screen
    \item Create the View Expenses screen
    \item Wire up backend functionality and data-processing
    \item Make it pretty
    \item UI polish (e.g. animations, etc.)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Evaluation}
To evaluate how our web app works for the purpose of this class, we will compare it to a commercial
application. Users will be asked to do a series of tasks then we will use a
NASA tlx based questionnaire to evaluate the user experience on both
applications. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Qualitative comparisons of ease of use vs competitors
    \item Qualitative representation of how enjoyable navigating and using the app is.
	\item NASA TLX, give the users tasks and evaluate there experience with NASA tlx
\end{enumerate}
