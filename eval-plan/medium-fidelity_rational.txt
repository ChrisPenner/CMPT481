We chose to use a use html, css and react/redux to implement our prototype.
There was a few reasons that we chose to use these technologies to implement our
medium-fidelity. As a group we were comfortable with html/css, since our
application is web based it made sense to implement it this way. This allowed us
also to play around with colours and themes for the application more easily. It
was very important to us that the interface looked good and html/css allows us
to do this.

For our prototype we chose to implement it vertically. The functionality that we
implemented in our prototype is the ability to add expenses to different
category's, set different limits and names for each of the categories and
graphical representation of the spending. Using the mixture of html/css and
react/redux allowed us to easily implement all these features to the extend
that we needed to make the application feel like it is fully functional. When it
comes to evaluating the users should not really be able to tell the application
is just a prototype.
