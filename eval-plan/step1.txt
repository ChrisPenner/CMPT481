The main usability challenge that we want to meet is the continued use of our
application, we will evaluate the users experience in the interview to see if at
that time they would want to use this software. The smaller goals that we also
wanted to evaluate if the user finds the application easy to use. The final
small goal of the evaluation is to see how quickly the users can input data, we
found that with other budgeting applications it was not quick to input different
category data. The main focus of our evaluation will be on the continued use of
our application.
