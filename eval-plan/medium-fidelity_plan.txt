(1) The medidum-fidelity prototype will be vertical. 
(2) It will have the following primary tasks to work:
	~ main screen
		~ visualize data for amount of spent versus not spent with respect to weekly/monthly/yearly budget
		~ category name above data bar
		~ total amount spent beside data bar (will show 0$ and no data bar if no money is spent in a category)
	~ settings screen
		~ add a budget limit (for a weekly budget)
		~ customize categories
			~ name
			~ amount showing (up to five)
	~ add an expense screen
		~ enter amount
		~ select category
	
In contrast we will not implement the following tasks functionality:
	~ main screen
		~ visualize data for amount spent versus not spent (weekly/monthly/yearly) in regards to each or one category
		~ total amount spent/saved beside data bar (will show 0$/saved and no data bar if no money is spent in a category)
	~ settings screen
		~ having the ability to create budgeting limits for each or one category
	~ removing an expense
	
(3) The appearance for our prototype is important as one of our goals is to make sure that the user has a positive experience using our application by a fast and accurate 
use. It is believed that for our app to attain this then it must appear to be clean, and minimal. 

(4) We do not have any physical elements to our project

(5)We chose to use HTML and CSS along with react and redux to implement our
medium fidelity prototype.(This is basically the Prototype rational portion of
the report)
