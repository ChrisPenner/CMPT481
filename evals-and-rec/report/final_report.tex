\section{Problem and Motivation}

In 1980, the ratio for debt-to-income in Canada is 66%; that ratio passed the 150% figure in 2011.
1 At a young age Canadians are taught how to count and spend money but we are not all taught how to
budget effectively. Whether you are a businessowner, student, or bringing home the bacon for your
family; it is important to budget. Budgeting allows a person to determine if they will have enough
money for what they need to do and what they would like to do. The reason people might fall in to
debt is the fact that they are spending more than they expected. If a person was to set aside a
predetermined amount of money that they wish to spend each week or month and could better visualize
their spending habits in relation to their saving. This will allow them to better prioritize their
budget and find areas to increase savings.

It can be easy to forget to add expenses as they occur throughout the day. Reasons for this may
include that the method of inputting their expenses is too time-consuming or difficult to use; or
that their budgeting application is not available on their mobile device. Many of the current
applications that are purposed towards tracking weekly or monthly recreational budgets (non
re-occurring bills and expenses) are not easy to use or engaging for the user. Most visualization
techniques present in other applications focus solely on the amount of money spent in each
category, however this overlooks the primary purpose of budgeting and does not deliver the
information of how the amount spent relates to the users savings goals. Many applications sacrifice
ease-of-use by adding clutter for additional (often unused) features. When navigating many of these
applications it can seem that there is ”too much going on”. Accessibility of the application can
also be an issue, disparity in interface between the Desktop and mobile versions can be a confusing
experience. Some applications are not available on all devices.

\section{Related Literature and Background}
\section{Description of The System}

    \subsection{Initial Prototype}

    The intention was to build an application that was as easy to use as
    possible, users should be able to jump right into the tasks without prior
    training and be able to complete them confidently and successfully. The
    easiest way to accomplish this was to minify the scope of the application
    to its simplest possible subset. Minimizing the number of actions available
    simplifies the interface and allows the user to navigate confidently.

    In the initial "Wizard of Oz" style paper prototype the interface was pared
    down to only 3 screens, one for each of the tasks users are allowed to
    perform:

    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
        \item Add an expense
        \item View expenses
        \item Customize budget allowances
    \end{itemize}

    As with any design process it was quickly discovered during trials that
    it was unclear how to perform certain actions; for instance there was no
    functionality for cancelling or removing an expense. Each hiccup was noted
    and changes were prioritized for the next prototyping stage.

    \subsection{Adjustments}
    
    The next prototype was constructed as a fully interactive and functional
    web application using Javascript, html and CSS. This allowed us to
    implement the functionality which was missing from our paper prototypes
    such as animations, calculations, and the use of real data.

    A critical analysis was performed on the data collected from the
    paper-prototype trials. This inspired a focus on displaying the information
    available as clearly as possible. Naturally the implementation met some
    obstacles and decisions were made to cut or work around some features.
    Features which were cut or altered include:

    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
        \item Saving data across sessions
        \item Cancelling expenses
        \item Viewing individual expenses
        \item Cancel buttons/back buttons
        \item Adding additional expense categories
    \end{itemize}

    Many features were determined to be "nice to have" but not crucial for the
    testing stage of this level of prototype. These concerns are addressed
    again in the retrospective portion of the report.

    Overall the choice of web technologies suited the implementation well;
    particularly the ability to use the same prototype on mobile and desktop.
    A familiarity with React and Redux allowed quick bug-free edits when
    concerns regarding functionality or layout were raised. The use of Redux
    specifically simplified the problem of syncing data across the application
    trivial. These choices were made within a forward thinking context, if the
    application were to move forward to large scale deployment the code may
    progress towards that goal.

    One of the greatest difficulties faced was that of creating a responsive
    layout that allowed code re-use across Mobile and Desktop devices. The
    preference was for the interfaces to be similar enough to allow habits
    formed on one device to transfer to the other. To this end CSS media-query
    rules were used extensively alongside the responsive CSS framework
    Bulma.io. Google Chrome's developer tools were instrumental in testing
    the interface on multiple mobile devices.

    Another challenge was the limited screen real-estate on mobile devices.
    Navigation items needed to be accessible without getting in the way.
    Additional complexity was added to the application to hide and show certain
    screens since there is not enough room on a mobile device for all screens
    to be showing at the same time.

    \subsection{Retrospective}

	As expected, user testing of the interactive prototype was very revealing of
    yet more flaws, but also of successes in our design. 

    The application failed to account for the change in idioms between mobile
    and desktop, i.e. users tried to edit categories or add expenses by touching
    interface elements. Most users mentioned that they would like more
    functionality, many of the requested features were originally part our the
    design but were left out due to time constraints, cluttering of the
    interface, or implementation difficulties.

    It seemed that the most difficulty was encountered in navigation between
    features and the discoverability of functionality. This suggests that this
    is an area of potentially large benefit with lower amounts of work.

    Some requested features were deliberately left out. For instance one user
    mentioned that they prefer that their budgeting app links to their bank
    account and tracks their expenses automatically. Not only was this out of
    scope for the time-frame of the project, but it is also contrary to the
    design principles of being as simple as possible. Several other features
    would be rejected for the purposes of keeping the interface clean and
    simple.

\section{Evaluation with User Reports}

	\subsection{Goals, Approach and Rational for the Evaluation}

		\subsubsection{Goals}

		The primary goal of our project is for users to use our application to continuously track their
		expenses. It is our belief that if the application is made easy to use through an intuitive
		interface and navigation then the user will also be able to input expenses quickly and efficiently.
		If the user can quickly tell us how much they have spent in a specific category after expenses have
		been entered then it confirms that the application is presenting a clear visualization of the data.
		Unfortunately the continued use of the application can not be tested within the scope of this class
		since that would require multiple interviews with the test users to evaluate their usage and a
		high-fidelity prototype.

		\subsubsection{Approach and Rational for the Evaluation}

		We will use interviews to evaluate our goals. Seeking to determine what they require to make their
		budgeting experience with our app the most enjoyable.


	\subsection{Actual Participant Pool and Other Execution Details}

	We had used a mixture of family/friends for our test cases. 

	\begin{labeling}{User 4}
		\item [User 1] An individual who has limited experience with computers.  
		\item [User 2] An individual who has a degree in computer science and may offer some valuable 
		criticisms. 
		\item [User 3] Older demographic who may have budgeted using other methods in the past.
		\item [User 4] A business student who has studied budgeting.
	\end{labeling}


	\subsection{Divergence from Milestone III Evaluation Plan}

	Upon implementing our Medium Fidelity-Prototype our task list had diverged from what we initially
	said our application would be able to do. Instead of only three tasks that would be able to be 
	performed, the application can now perform five different tasks:
	
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item Add an expense (unchanged)
		\item View expenses over a weeks/months/years time (unchanged)
		\item Change an overall budget (unchanged)
		\item Change a category name
		\item Set a budget limit for one or all categories
	\end{itemize}

	We had also said that our redesign would offer cancellation of actions to improve user experiense,
	however we did not include a cancellation option in our "Add Expense" page for the mobile interface.

	\subsection{Results}

	While examining the results from the interviews it was clear that there were both positive and 
	negative themes. The users appeared to have a preconceived notion on how our application should
	work from applications they had used in the past, even apps unrelated to budgeting. Due to this
	knowledge transfer it had caused both positive and negative feedback. 
	
	Some common positive themes shared amongst the users were:
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item Similar interfaces between mobile and desktop
		\item Easy and quick to add expenses
		\item Nice animations
	\end{itemize}
	Where once the user had learned how to use the application the fact that the desktop and mobile
	interfaces were so similar, it allowed users to switch between the two with minimal confusion. 
	The animations engaged the users when they had added expenses into the application. 
	
	\subsubsection{Negative Themes}
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item It should be more customizable
		\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
			\item Pick default view
			\item Have more categories
		\end{itemize}
		\item More indepth data 
		\item Have the ability to click the label or the bar for the category to be able to edit the name of the category or view more data
	\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection
	
	User \#2 as expected went above and beyond when supplying feedback. They had mentioned for design ideas  

	\subsection{Conclusion}

	And more stuff here.

\section{Final Recommendations}

- Did our design change as a result of user

Yes:

- Shifting layout of interface
- Mobile: change main page to be add-expense screen
- Move and add label for Settings button.
- Label any 'icons' with text
- Users want more customizability
- Users wanted the features we hadn't implemented
- Track individual expenses
- Change orientation of graphs
- Add cancel buttons
- Make it more intuitive for a touch interface (users touched labels)

Stop now, go back to where you were 12 weeks ago, and decide whether anything has changed in your perspective. 
- People think they want more functionality than we think they need.

What have you learned about the user-centered design process, over the course of the entire project? 

- Should have run more trials at lower fidelity
- Users are dumber in some ways and smarter in others
- It's useful
- It's easier to get negative feedback rather than positive.

Did it work for you? 

- Yes, we learned and were able to use user's feedback for the better

Did the methods you chose for your evaluation and prototyping get at what you were looking for? 
- Yes, the interview was a good process, the medium fidelity worked well.
- The Low fidelity could have been done better/replaced with something else

In hindsight, would a different approach have been better? 

- For low fidelity it would have been useful to do a more interactive and comprehensive prototype like axure or 
even more advanced paper prototypes with colours and shapes.

What were the most, and least, valuable among the activities we’ve asked you to try out, either generally or 
specifically for your project?

- Most valuable was conducting guided interviews, these prompted lots of useful feedback from users.
- Low fidelity prototyping was useful in general, we re-architected our design and approach several times as a result
- 10x10 design was useful

- Time could have been shifted to allow more time for higher-fidelity testing and user engagement.

Having gone through this course, how might you approach your next interface
design project (whether for fun/personal or work, large or small) differently?

- Spend more time on design and planning before jumping in.
- Get more people to test it out rather than just myself.
- Interview testers and users with probing questions rather than just asking "what do you think"
