\section{Evaluation with Users Report}


\subsection{Goals, Approach and Rational for the Evaluation}

\subsubsection{Goals}

The primary goal of our project is for users to use our application to continuously track their
expenses. It is our belief that if the application is made easy to use through an intuitive
interface and navigation then the user will also be able to input expenses quickly and efficiently.
If the user can quickly tell us how much they have spent in a specific category after expenses have
been entered then it confirms that the application is presenting a clear visualization of the data.
Unfortunately the continued use of the application can not be tested within the scope of this class
since that would require multiple interviews with the test users to evaluate their usage and a
high-fidelity prototype.

\subsubsection{Approach and Rational for the Evaluation}

We will use interviews to evaluate our goals. Seeking to determine what they require to make their
budgeting experience with our app the most enjoyable.


\subsection{Actual Participant Pool and Other Execution Details}

We had used a mixture of family/friends for our test cases. 

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item User 1 An individual who has limited experience with computers.  
	\item User 2 An individual who has a degree in computer science and may offer some valuable 
	criticisms. 
	\item User 3 Older demographic who may have budgeted using other methods in the past.
	\item User 4 A business student who has studied budgeting.
\end{itemize}
