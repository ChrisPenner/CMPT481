\section{Problem and Motivation}

In 1980, the ratio for debt-to-income in Canada is 66%; that ratio passed the 150% figure in 2011.
1 At a young age Canadians are taught how to count and spend money but we are not all taught how to
budget effectively. Whether you are a businessowner, student, or bringing home the bacon for your
family; it is important to budget. Budgeting allows a person to determine if they will have enough
money for what they need to do and what they would like to do. The reason people might fall in to
debt is the fact that they are spending more than they expected. If a person was to set aside a
predetermined amount of money that they wish to spend each week or month and could better visualize
their spending habits in relation to their saving. This will allow them to better prioritize their
budget and find areas to increase savings.

It can be easy to forget to add expenses as they occur throughout the day. Reasons for this may
include that the method of inputting their expenses is too time-consuming or difficult to use; or
that their budgeting application is not available on their mobile device. Many of the current
applications that are purposed towards tracking weekly or monthly recreational budgets (non
re-occurring bills and expenses) are not easy to use or engaging for the user. Most visualization
techniques present in other applications focus solely on the amount of money spent in each
category, however this overlooks the primary purpose of budgeting and does not deliver the
information of how the amount spent relates to the users savings goals. Many applications sacrifice
ease-of-use by adding clutter for additional (often unused) features. When navigating many of these
applications it can seem that there is ”too much going on”. Accessibility of the application can
also be an issue, disparity in interface between the Desktop and mobile versions can be a confusing
experience. Some applications are not available on all devices.
