	[User 4]
	- Found the setting icon confusing
	- More differentiation between buttons and labels would be helpful to make
	  things work better 	
	- make the switching between weekly/monthly/yearly view easier to see
	- increment amounts by 10 using arrows instead of the number pad
	- More categories 
	- "Add Another" button - wasn't sure it would save first entry


Outliers:
~ It would be cool to have a widget so you can add an expense really easily without having 
  to open the app. Customizable widgets too, so if you wanted a quick add expense button, 
  or if you wanted to just see where you were budget wise(total amount spent versus 
  remaining budget amount, OR only total spent, OR only remaining budget amount)

~ Your app is easier to use if you are not wanting to have it tied to bank accounts, and is
  easier to add expenses.
~ I like Mint.com because it has the ability to track not just the value of what you spent
  but also when and what the expense was for
~ user 2 would want a more complete and complicated app to continue using
the application

- Could have flipped graphs to make them all fit on the screen
- More of a learning curve on the mobile version then desktop

~ Don't like that you can't see budget numbers on screen 
~ Add indicator that you're getting close to the budget limit, have a bar, half of what

Jonathan's thoughts and comments:
The users wanted to be able to do more, they wanted to be able to customize the
app more to there needs. Almost all of the users wanted to have more features
and do more with the app. They all found it quick and easy to input the data but
wanted to be able to view more data about spending. Issues came from the gear
button for the setting 3 of the users had an issue with this, a label for
setting might help. The mobile experience was easier then the desktop experience
which is what we wanted to achieve. Given the limited data that we have gathered
users liked the fast input but are willing to invest more time in seeing
different stats on there data. Most were not satisfied with the limited
information on there spending.

We achieved some of our goals for the application. We were able to get fast
input and reading of graphs but the viewing of the spending is not a main
concern. Users wanted a more complicated interface that tells them information
and not just a stripped down application
