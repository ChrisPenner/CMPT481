Tasks we get the users to perform
	~ adding different expenses to two or three different categories
	~ after adding expenses, (go to screen) for data visualization
	~ changing the name of a category
	~ changing the overall budget limit (it will originally be set to 200$)
	~ change one category limit
	~ add more expenses to that category and get it to go over the budget limit
	

	
	

Pre Demo:
	1. Do you currently or have you ever budget(ed)?
		Personally? No, maybe, techincally yes. Never followed it. User #4 created a budget for the
		sake a creating a budget. Doesn't believe budgets to be beneficial. Here we talked about
		some pros and cons.
			~ "I'm a seasonal worker, would make more sense to budget if I had a consistent 
			   income."
					~ "Wouldn't it then make more sense to budget? You know you have this much 
					   money for these many months, budget to make sure you end by breaking even or
					   by ending in a surplus."
		User #4 says their way of budgeting is by asking "do I have enough money for the year?" 
		Where they are "Naturally frugal" they don't make many big purchases and when they do it 
		doesn't make a big difference. 

	
Desktop Demo:
	1. Add three expenses to three different categories
		~ User #4 had tried using the arrows to increment the amount he was adding but quickly 
		  changed to the num pad.
		~ Asked for clarification if he was adding an expense for a day/week/month/year 
	2. Change the name of a category
		~ Clicked on the category name
		~ Clicked on the drop down for adding expenses to a specific category
		~ Clicked on the settings gear and said "ahh"

		
Post Desktop Demo Interview:
	1. Was there anything thing that you found counter intuitive?
		~ "Add an expense" text makes him think that he can click on it to add an expense, didn't
		  immediately realize it was a title. 
		~ Not immediately drawn to the settings gear, clicked on the category title, then the 
		  category bar, then the category drop down (that you want to add an expense to) to try to
		  change the name of the category first.
		~ Scrolling arrows to increment added expense amount is weird, goes up by one.
		
	2. If you could change/add things about the app, what would it be? (From desktop perspective)
		~ Have the arrows to increment added expense increment amount by 10
		~ Have category names/bars clickable to change category name/add expense/see total expenses
		~ See the arrows to change between weekly/monthly/yearly be more prominent. Didn't notice 
		  that until the interviewer pointed them out. 
		~ Have it be more customizable
			~ Wants to be able to have more categories (more than 5)
		

Mobile Demo:
	1. Add two expenses to two different categories
		~ User #4 missed the "Add Another" button
			~ After he added the second expense the interviewer asked him to add another expense 
			  but this time click that button instead of "Done"
	2. Asked to go to yearly expenses
		~ Swiped immediately

		
Post Mobile Demo Interview:
	1. Was there anything thing that you found counter intuitive?
		~ "Add Another" button - wasn't sure it would save first entry
		~ pressing back button on mobile device ruined data
		~ clicking save "what if I don't want to save it?"
		~ swiping was intuitive - didn't notice arrows though
		
	2. If you could change/add things about the app, what would it be? (From mobile perspective)
		~ In settings 
			~ Change it so that you can see what you're typing in for a category limit
			~ Have more categories!
		~ On main page
			~ Click the category label/bar to add expense
			~ Don't like that you can't see budget numbers on screen 
			~ Add indicator that you're getting close to the budget limit, have a bar, half of what
			  you've spent, half what you have left in budget to spend
			~ See what you're spending day/month


Post Demos:
	1. How did you find the mobile interface versus the desktop interface
		~ Gear was much better on mobile, had to figure it out still though
		~ Pretty much the same
		~ Desktop has stuff you can do from the main page, mobile has another screen (quick and easy to
		  use)
		
		a. (Probing Question) Which was easiest to use?
			~ Both were easy
		
		b. (Probing Question) For you what made the data more visually clear for you?
			~ Desktop because on mobile the screen is crammed. 
				~ Have mobile main screen be add expense and data be a separate page showing all 
				  weekly/monthly/yearly on one page.
		
	2. (If they haven't budgeted before) Would you conttinnue using this app to budget?
		~ No. It doesn't do much. Want to view list of individual expenses.
		~ More data, what days you spent, how much you spent, how it changes week to week.
