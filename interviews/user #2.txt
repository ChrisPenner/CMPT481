Tasks we get the users to perform
	~ adding different expenses to two or three different categories
	~ after adding expenses, (go to screen) for data visualization
	~ changing the name of a category
	~ changing the overall budget limit (it will originally be set to 200$)
	~ change one category limit
	~ add more expenses to that category and get it to go over the budget limit
	
	
	
		

Pre Demo:
	1. Do you currently or have you ever budget(ed)?
		Yes. Right now User #4 doesn't budget actively but they do use Mint.com to make sure old
		accounts don't have stuff on them and go through current accounts to ensure there are no
		unknown purchases. 
		
		In the past they used spreadsheets for projecting, and sometimes User #4 still uses this
		method for their savings and for bigger purchases. 
		
		User #4 says that they have a facade for budgeting. "Mint.com sucks for things that run over
		multiple months."

	
Desktop Demo:
	1. Add three expenses to three different categories
		~ Saw animations and said "Aw thats fancy"
		~ Didn't use the arrows to increment/decrement
		~ Added negative numbers
		~ Found out he could input 'e' (didn't do anything except clear any numbers previously 
		  typed)
			~ When asked why the letter User #4 answered "only because I was allowed to"
	2. Go to monthly view
		~ Highlighted "Weekly View"
		~ Went into Settings
			~ Hit browser back button
	4. Change the overall budget
		~ Tried to add -0.10, changed to "NaN"
	5. Max a category
		~ Entered 9.99
			~ Entered 0.01
				~ Didn't max

		
Post Desktop Demo Interview:
	1. Was there anything thing that you found counter intuitive?
		~ Switching between views, the arrows on side made User #4 thing that it would go to a 
		  history. "Although the forward wouldn't make sense for this."
		~ Click category label to change the name
		
	2. If you could change/add things about the app, what would it be? (From desktop perspective)
		~ Expected a drop down to toggle views
		~ Add back button to settings page (or a cancel button)
		~ Hover over category label to see a button to edit the name
		~ Want to be able to see if you're increasing or decreasing spending of money of if theres a 
		  certain time of the year you're spending more money (VERY IMPORTANT TO USER - Charting
		  over time)
		~ Can't see actual expenses of what you're spending per day on what day
		~ Only tracking expenses and not income
		

Mobile Demo:
	1. Add two expenses to two different categories
		~ Used "Add Another"
	2. Asked to go to yearly expenses view
		~ Didn't swipe

		
Post Mobile Demo Interview:
	1. Was there anything thing that you found counter intuitive?
		~ No, there were things I'd change
		
	2. If you could change/add things about the app, what would it be? (From mobile perspective)
		~ On Add Expense Page
			~ Make it so the category budget is visible
			~ Add back or cancel button
			~ Light colours for buttons don't look like it's disabled
				~ Make it grey, or have a notification to say why you can't add an expense
				~ Can't do anything if there is no category selected, but can do something if there
				  is no expense inputted, weird
		~ In settings 
			~ Add back or cancel button
		~ On main page
			~ Change arrows to three dots to know to swipe
		~ It would be cool to have a widget so you can add an expense really easily without having 
		  to open the app. Customizable widgets too, so if you wanted a quick add expense button, 
		  or if you wanted to just see where you were budget wise(total amount spent versus 
		  remaining budget amount, OR only total spent, OR only remaining budget amount)


Post Demos:
	1. How did you find the mobile interface versus the desktop interface
		~ It was nice that they both had the same features available. Mint.com disables some
		  features for their mobile application
		
		a. (Probing Question) Which was easiest to use?
			~ Desktop was easiest to use because I can use the refresh button to get out of the
			  settings page without having to hit "Save"
			  
		b. (Probing Question) For you what made the data more visually clear for you?
			~ No difference
		
	2. (If they have budgeted before) Have you tried using other budgeting apps before, how did ours 
	   compare? (Mint.com)
		~ It's not a fair comparison because mint.com is a professional product made by an 
		  international finance company
		~ Your app is easier to use if you are not wanting to have it tied to bank accounts, and is
		  easier to add expenses.
		~ I like Mint.com because it has the ability to track not just the value of what you spent
		  but also when and what the expense was for
		  
		a. (Yes - Probing Question) What app allowed you fast input?
			~ For cash expenses your app is faster, or for expenses if you can't link an account. 
			~ Mint.com credit card expenses are delayed, however debit transactions are faster 
			
		b. (Yes - Probing Question) What app allowed more accurate input?
			~ It's the same,  both can still see wha tthe amount is before it gets used
			~ For choosing categories your app is harder, Mint doesn't require me to worry about a
			  box (for inputting the amount)
		
		c. (Yes - Probing Question) How likely to continue using ours or the other one?
			It has potential, but I wouldn't currently use it.
			
			If I were to use it I would want to include location and date of the expense. US is 
			okay as is, not ideal. I want to be able to go back and change past expenses. I want
			more data out of the program. Don't want expenses to be summed up. Want monthly budget
			or yearly budget, don't care about weekly budget. In fact, I want monthly budget to be 
			the default view, and it not be a sum of the weekly budget. Also the ability to add 
			income and assets, or my specific bank accounts. 
			
			i. (Probing Question) With those changes would you use this app over Mint.com 
			   consistently? 
				~ With those changes? Yes.
