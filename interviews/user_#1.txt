Before the user performs the aforementioned tasks we will sit down with them and ask the following 
questions:

	yes, using pen and paper. Currently budget using this method. 
		(Yes - Probing Question) What method do you use?
		(No - Probing Question) Is there a specific reason why?
	
Tasks we get the users to perform
	~ adding different expenses to two or three different categories
		-Tried to click on the expense graph to add an expense
		-Made an error of adding an expense to the housing cat. forgot to change
		 from the food cat.
		- found it easy to see the overage

	~ after adding expenses, (go to screen) for data visualization
	~ changing the name of a category
		- Did not recognise the setting button!
		- had no problems adding the new cat. name
	~ changing the overall budget limit (it will originally be set to 200$)
		- once the settings screen was known no problem with this
	~ change one category limit
		- was confused on where to find this but once found it was easy to do
	~ add more expenses to that category and get it to go over the budget limit
	- overall found it intutive, she didn't know what the settings button was!


First we will get the users to perform these tasks on a laptop/desktop browser. 
While they are doing this we will watch how quickly and accurately they are able to fufill the 
tasks. 
If they appear to be moving slowly or talking to themselves during this process we will ask them
to elaborate their thought process immediately. After they're finished the tasks ask:
	Was there anything thing that you found counter intuitive?
	 - found the setting button confusing
	 - graphs were easy to read and understand when went over
	If you could change/add things about the app, what would it be? (From desktop perspective)
		- would like to be able to adjust if an ammount is entered wrong

We will then proceed to get the users to perform these tasks on a mobile device of their 
preference.
